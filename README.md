# NYTsearch

You can use this app under the following link:
https://bartekkwapisz.github.io/nyt2/index.html

First choose number of visible articles.
Then choose dates for desired articles.
Finally click "Get articles!" button.

If second date is earlier than first, you'll get an error massage.
Using pagination (from 1 to 120) you can select other articles from time between two dates.
